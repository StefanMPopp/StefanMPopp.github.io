TODO: biography/links to projects; Anna's link; news; projects; CV; teaching; what else I'm passionate about.

I am a behavioral biologist trying to uncover the rules of behavior, the 'behavioral algorithms', or the 'program' runnnig in the 'minds' of organisms when making a decision. I am mainly interested in 'simple' organisms like ants, but am equally fascinated by the algorithms in human behavior.

I am currently working on an agent-based model helping to explain how ants searching for resources create regular meanders on multiple scales, and how much more efficient this search strategy is compared to simpler alternatives.

Throughout my undergrad and master's studies I have been focusing on ants as a model system, performing research on their [communication](/projects/4_project/), colony organization, and foraging behaviors. During my [PhD](/projects/1_project/), I investigated the movement patterns of ants as they were searching for resources of unknown location.
During this time I also performed modeling studies on [collective behavior](/projects/2_project/) and track processing methods in [movement ecology](/projects/3_project/).
