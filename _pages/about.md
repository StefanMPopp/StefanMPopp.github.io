TODO: news; projects; CV; teaching; what else I'm passionate about.

As a recent PhD graduate in animal behavior, I have gained extensive experience in data analysis, manipulation, and visualization, using various software tools and languages, such as MATLAB, Python, R, and bash. I have applied my skills to study the complex and fascinating patterns of ant movement and communication, using advanced video tracking and statistical analysis techniques.

I am passionate about finding answers from data and solving technical problems, as well as collaborating with experts from different fields. I have initiated and contributed to several interdisciplinary projects with computer scientists and mathematicians, resulting in multiple publications and presentations. I am also a proficient and quick writer, with a keen eye for detail and quality. I am eager to work on projects and challenges which allow me to have a tangible real-world impact.

I am currently working on an agent-based model helping to explain how ants searching for resources create regular meanders on multiple scales, and how much more efficient this search strategy is compared to simpler alternatives.

Throughout my undergrad and master's studies I have been focusing on ants as a model system, performing research on their [communication](/projects/4_project/), colony organization, and foraging behaviors. During my [PhD](/projects/1_project/), I investigated the movement patterns of ants as they were searching for resources of unknown location.
During this time I also performed modeling studies on [collective behavior](/projects/2_project/) and track processing methods in [movement ecology](/projects/3_project/).
