<h3>YouTube</h3>
Starting at the end of my Master's studies, I have been producing weekly (then monthly) vlogs (video-blogs) about my life as an international graduate student at the University of Arizona. I have received numerous feedback that my videos were helpful for students who were either deciding on a program, university, or whether grad school was for them, or who wanted to gain more information about the program after being accepted.
I am still in the process of publishing the videos from the last few years of my PhD.

<h3>In-person events</h3>
I loved participating in outreach events, where members of the general public (mostly school students) could learn about the work I was doing, science in general, or just about the wonderful world of social insects.

Picture incoming!
