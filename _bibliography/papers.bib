  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

	abstract = {Coordinated movement in animal groups (flocks, schools, herds, etc.) is a classic and well-studied form of collective behaviour. Most theoretical studies consider agents in unobstructed spaces; however, many animals move in often complicated environments and must navigate around and through obstacles. Here we consider simulated agents behaving according to typical flocking rules, with the addition of repulsion from obstacles, and study their collective behaviour in environments with concave obstacles (dead ends). We find that groups of such agents heading for a goal can spontaneously escape dead ends without wall-following or other specialized behaviours, in what we term ‘flocking escapes’. The mechanism arises when agents align with one another while heading away from the goal, forming a self-stable cluster that persists long enough to exit the obstacle and avoids becoming trapped again when turning back towards the goal. Solitary agents under the same conditions are never observed to escape. We show that alignment with neighbours reduces the effective turning speed of the group while letting individuals maintain high manoeuvrability when needed. The relative robustness of flocking escapes in our studies suggests that this emergent behaviour may be relevant for a variety of animal species.},

	abstract = {Central-place foragers must learn the resource and visual landscapes around them when they are in a new environment, to facilitate efficient foraging and navigation. We investigated how the colony-level exploration strategy of Temnothorax rugatulus ants changes over time. For this study, we introduced ants to a novel environment by placing them in a foraging arena and tracking their movements over 3 days for 5 h per day, prohibiting access to the arena at other times. To test whether any changes in movement behavior are due to chemical markings, we replaced the paper floor on the third day. We found that colony-level exploration activity decreased with time, but only within a roughly 1 m radius around the nest, possibly reflecting a shift from familiarization or marking walks to searching. Individuals’ movements overall also became slightly straighter and faster across and within days. However, unlike learning walks of other ant species, T. rugatulus ants did not pause more often when facing toward the nest. Reactions to chemical markings seem to play a minor role in our observed effects, as the exploratory behavior did not reset after the floor cover had been replaced. Thus, ant colony exploration and search behaviors adapt to the familiarity of their environment by becoming more dispersive, possibly aiding in search efficiency. This must be considered in lab studies on the foraging activity and behavior of ants.},
