For my Bachelor's thesis, I worked with [Dr. Tomer Czaczkes](https://www.animal-economics.com/) (Univ. Regensburg) on the question whether ants who are on their way back to the nest from a food source can tell outgoing, naive ants, whether to go left or right at a fork in the way. After carefully providing the best circumstances for this to happen, we concluded that _Lasius niger_ ants do not possess this ability. However, to solidify this null result, we collaborated with [Dr. Elva Robinson](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/research/ecology-evolution/elva-robinson/) and Dr. Philipp Buckham-Bonnet, at the University of York, to repeat the experiment in a different lab with a slightly different setup, and a closely related species (_Lasius neglectus_). We combined these two datasets with that of a very similar study by [Dr. Sophie E. F. Evison](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/life-sciences/people/sophie.evison) to conclude with high certainty that this type of ant does not convey directional information to naive ants on a foraging trail via physical contact.
