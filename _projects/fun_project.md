<h3>bike touring</h3>
I love traveling by bike. My longest tour was in 2014 from my home town Wurzburg, Germany, to Avignon, France (2000km, 2 weeks). I then continued this journey from Avignon to Carcassonne (470km, 4 days) in 2023. I aim to eventually arrive at the westernmost point of the European continent.

<h3>language learning</h3>
I enjoy learning (about) languages. Currently, I am learning (or 'acquiring') French with the Comprehensible Input method. That means, no explicit grammar or vocab learning, but only getting lots of input (I prefer video & audio) which is 80-90% comprehensible. The goal is to be interested in the material itself, such that the language will naturally be acquired as a side effect. After ~220h of language exposure, I can understand on a B2 level - I will wait with speaking practice until the French words leave my mouth on their own.

<h3>growing mushrooms</h3>
One of my hobbies became the growing of gourmet mushrooms at home. It doesn't have to be difficult and is highly rewarding.
